# RIO Predictor Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Observation Analyzed**: permno 10014, yyyymm 192904 (Python=1, Stata=5, diff=-4)  
**Status**: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

## Summary
The RIO predictor precision failures are **NOT** caused by rolling volatility calculation differences or time-based window issues as initially hypothesized. The root cause is **missing institutional ownership data handling** causing `-inf` values in RIO calculations.

## Root Cause: Missing Institutional Ownership Data

### The Problem Chain:
1. **Missing Data**: `instown_perc` = NaN for many observations (including our target)
2. **Python Logic**: When `instown_perc` is NaN → `temp = 0.0`
3. **RIO Calculation**: `RIO = log(temp/(1-temp)) = log(0/(1-0)) = log(0) = -inf`
4. **Quintile Breaking**: `-inf` values break fastxtile ranking → all missing data gets cat_RIO = 1
5. **Final Result**: RIO_Volatility = cat_RIO when cat_Volatility = 5 → RIO_Volatility = 1 instead of 5

### Evidence from Debugging:
```
Target observation (permno=10014, yyyymm=192904):
- instown_perc: NaN
- temp: 0.0 (due to missing data handling)
- RIO: -inf (log(0) = -inf)
- RIOlag: -inf
- cat_RIO: 1 (bottom quintile due to -inf)
- Volatility: 0.295474 ✅ (calculation works correctly)
- cat_Volatility: 5 ✅ (quintile works correctly)
- RIO_Volatility: 1 (should be 5)
```

## Comparison: Python vs Stata

### Current Python Logic:
```python
df = df.with_columns(
    pl.when(pl.col("instown_perc").is_null())
    .then(0.0)  # ❌ This causes log(0) = -inf
    .when(pl.col("instown_perc") / 100 > 0.9999)
    .then(0.9999)
    .when(pl.col("instown_perc") / 100 < 0.0001)
    .then(0.0001)
    .otherwise(pl.col("instown_perc") / 100)
    .alias("temp")
)
```

### Stata Logic (from .do file):
```stata
gen temp = instown_perc/100
replace temp = 0 if mi(temp)        ; ❌ Same issue: sets to 0
replace temp = .9999 if temp > .9999
replace temp = .0001 if temp < .0001
```

**Wait... this suggests Stata has the same logic!** 

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: Data Coverage Gap

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: TR_13F institutional ownership data coverage analysis reveals:

- **SignalMasterTable**: 1925-12-01 to 2024-12-01 (99 years coverage)
- **TR_13F**: 1979-03-01 to 2024-09-01 (45 years coverage)  
- **GAP**: **53.2 years** of missing institutional ownership data (1925-1979)

### Evidence:
```
Target observation (permno=10014, yyyymm=192904 = April 1929):
❌ NOT FOUND in TR_13F
✅ EXISTS in SignalMasterTable

TR_13F coverage for permno 10014: 0 observations
Reason: TR_13F starts in 1979, target is from 1929
```

This **definitively explains both major issues**:

### 1. Missing Observations (4.40% superset failure)
- All observations from 1925-1979 have NO institutional ownership data
- These observations either get filtered out OR get invalid `-inf` RIO calculations
- Target observation falls in this gap period

### 2. Precision Failures (26.58% systematic bias)  
- Observations from 1925-1979 get `instown_perc = NaN` 
- → `temp = 0.0` → `RIO = log(0) = -inf` → `cat_RIO = 1` (bottom quintile)
- Should get proper quintile distribution, but forced into bottom quintile
- Explains why Python consistently gives 1-4 while Stata gives 5

## Impact Analysis

### Scale of the Problem:
- **RIO_Volatility**: 4.40% superset failure, 26.58% precision1 failure
- **Pattern**: Python consistently assigns lower quintiles than Stata (Python=1-4, Stata=5)
- **Cause**: Firms with missing institutional ownership data getting cat_RIO=1 instead of proper quintiles

### Test Results Pattern:
```
Largest Differences (all -4):
permno  yyyymm  python  stata  diff
10014   192904       1      5    -4
10014   192905       1      5    -4
10014   192906       1      5    -4
```

This consistent -4 difference strongly supports the missing institutional ownership hypothesis.

## ✅ CONFIRMED FIX STRATEGY

### Immediate Actions Required:

#### 1. **URGENT: Check Stata's TR_13F Data Coverage** 
- Stata might have different/extended institutional ownership data covering 1925-1979
- Or Stata uses a different approach for missing institutional ownership periods

#### 2. **Fix Missing Data Handling**
Instead of setting missing institutional ownership to 0.0 (causing -inf):
```python
# ❌ CURRENT (causes -inf):
.when(pl.col("instown_perc").is_null()).then(0.0)

# ✅ PROPOSED OPTIONS:
# Option A: Use historical average or industry median
# Option B: Exclude from RIO calculation entirely  
# Option C: Use alternative proxy for early periods
# Option D: Match Stata's exact approach
```

#### 3. **Implement Robust -inf Handling**
Apply guidance from `DocsForClaude/stata_fastxtile.md`:
```python
# Clean infinite values before quintile calculation
RIOlag_clean = RIOlag.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)
cat_RIO = fastxtile(RIOlag_clean, n=5, by="time_avail_m")
```

#### 4. **Validate Against Stata Logic**
- Check how Stata RIO calculation handles missing institutional ownership for 1925-1979
- Ensure Python replicates Stata's exact approach for this period

## Key Insights

1. ✅ **Volatility calculation is correct** - no time-based window issues
2. ✅ **Quintile logic is correct** - fastxtile standardization works properly  
3. ❌ **Missing data handling breaks RIO calculation** - core issue
4. ❌ **Infinite values break quintile rankings** - secondary issue

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Check TR_13F data coverage differences
2. **Fix**: Implement proper handling of missing institutional ownership data
3. **Validate**: Re-run tests to confirm precision improvements
4. **Document**: Update fastxtile documentation with infinite value handling guidance

## Historical Note

This analysis corrects the initial hypothesis about rolling volatility and time-based windows. The actual issue is much more fundamental - missing data handling in the RIO calculation itself. This demonstrates the importance of step-by-step debugging rather than assumptions based on symptoms.
