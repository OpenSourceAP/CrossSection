# AbnormalAccruals Debug Analysis - Regression Sample Differences 

## Task Executed
Executed `Plan/miniplan-logdebug.md` to debug precision failures in `ZZ2_AbnormalAccruals_AbnormalAccrualsPercent.py`.

## Key Findings

### Checkpoint Analysis
Systematically compared Python output with Stata log checkpoints for permno 79702:

**‚úÖ Checkpoint 1-3**: Perfect match
- tempCFO, tempAccruals, tempInvTA values match exactly
- SIC2 industry codes match (sic=2836, sic2=28)

**‚ùå Checkpoint 4**: Major differences in regression step
- **Stata**: fyear=2017, _Nobs=564, _residuals=-1.5031402
- **Python**: fyear=2017, _Nobs=590, _residuals=-2.383081
- **Issue**: Python includes 26 extra observations (590 vs 564)

### Root Cause
The precision failure (27.950% bad observations) stems from **systematic sample selection differences** before the cross-sectional regression step. Python includes observations that Stata excludes, leading to different regression coefficients and residuals.

### Debug Investigation
1. **Created exact replication script**: Found Python gets 568 observations for fyear=2017, sic2=28 after proper filtering (much closer to Stata's 564)
2. **Tested asreg parameter changes**: 
   - solve_method: "svd" ‚Üí "lu" (no improvement)
   - min_samples: 1 ‚Üí 6 (no improvement)
3. **Verified data calculations**: tempDelRev and other variables match Stata exactly

### Hypotheses Tested
1. ‚ùå **asreg solve method differences**: LU vs SVD didn't change results
2. ‚ùå **min_samples parameter**: Adjusting from 1 to 6 didn't affect sample size
3. üîç **Missing value handling**: Sample difference (568 vs 564) suggests 4 observations with subtle missing value handling differences

## Status
- **Precision**: Still failing at 27.950%
- **Progress**: Identified exact source (regression sample differences)
- **Next Steps**: Need to investigate the 4-observation difference between Python (568) and Stata (564) for fyear=2017, sic2=28

## Files Modified
- Attempted changes in `ZZ2_AbnormalAccruals_AbnormalAccrualsPercent.py` (reverted)
- Created debug scripts in `Debug/` folder
- Updated `Plan/plan-prec-logdebug.md` with ATTEMPTED status
