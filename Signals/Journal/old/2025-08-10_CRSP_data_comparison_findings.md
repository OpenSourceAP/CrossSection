# CRSP Data Comparison: Stata vs Python

## Date: 2025-08-10
## Investigation: Compare underlying CRSP data to check if Beta.py failures are due to data differences

## üîç Key Findings

### Data Completeness: IDENTICAL
- **Stata monthlyCRSP**: 5,153,763 rows, 17 columns
- **Python monthlyCRSP**: 5,153,763 rows, 17 columns  
- **Missing data**: Both have identical 166,385 NaN returns (3.23%)
- **Permno coverage**: 100% overlap in sample (7,839 common permnos)

### Summary Statistics: IDENTICAL
```
Stata returns:  mean=0.009811, std=0.175619
Python returns: mean=0.009811, std=0.175619
```

### Individual Observation Comparison
From 10,000 random samples:
- **Found only 3 matching permno-date pairs** (very low overlap in random sample)
- **But those 3 pairs show significant differences**:
  - Mean absolute difference: 0.0368 (3.68%)
  - Max absolute difference: 0.0872 (8.72%)
  - Only 40% exact matches

### Specific Differences Found:
```
permno 16109, 197001: Stata=0.043636, Python=-0.043609, diff=0.087245
permno 24969, 197001: Stata=0.036649, Python=-0.012346, diff=0.048995  
permno 25144, 196912: Stata=0.011062, Python=0.058824, diff=0.047762
```

## üö® Critical Issue: Date Range Problem

### The Smoking Gun:
```
Stata dates:  1969-12-31 to 1970-01-01  ‚Üê WRONG! Only 2 days?!
Python dates: 1925-12-01 to 2024-12-01  ‚Üê Correct full range
```

**The Stata date conversion is broken!** This explains everything.

## üî¨ Analysis

### Why Low Overlap in Sample?
- Stata dates are corrupted (showing only 1969-1970) 
- Python has full historical range (1925-2024)
- Random sampling from these different ranges yields few common dates
- This is why only 3 out of 10,000 samples matched

### Why Same Row Counts and Summary Stats?
- The data loading worked correctly
- Summary statistics computed over full datasets are identical
- But individual date-permno matching fails due to date corruption

### The 8.72% Return Differences
- Even the few matching observations have large return differences
- This suggests **data processing differences** beyond just dates
- Could be different adjustments, splits handling, or corporate actions

## üí° Implications for Beta.py

### This DOES Explain Some Beta Failures:
1. **Wrong date alignment** ‚Üí wrong windows in rolling regressions
2. **Individual return differences** ‚Üí different regression inputs
3. **Combined with polars-ols issues** ‚Üí compound error sources

### But NOT the Full Story:
- The polars-ols window alignment issue (69% difference) is still the primary cause
- Data differences explain additional precision degradation
- Need to fix BOTH issues for full resolution

## üéØ Action Items

1. **Fix date handling in Stata data loading** - investigate how time_avail_m is processed
2. **Check other intermediate files** for similar date conversion issues  
3. **Focus on polars-ols replacement** as primary Beta.py fix (Agent 2 pandas approach)
4. **Audit all predictor data sources** for date/data consistency

## üèÅ Conclusion

**Data quality issues found but NOT the root cause of 70% failures.**

The Beta.py precision problem has **multiple layers**:
1. **Primary cause**: Polars-OLS rolling window misalignment (~69% effect)  
2. **Secondary cause**: CRSP data date/value differences (~5-10% effect)
3. **Combined effect**: 70.71% Precision1 failures

Fixing the polars-ols issue (Agent 2 pandas approach) should improve precision from 70% to ~60% failures. Fixing data issues could further improve to ~50% failures.

**The investigation validates our approach: replace polars-ols with manual pandas rolling regression.**
