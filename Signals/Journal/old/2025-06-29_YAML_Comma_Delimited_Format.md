# YAML Column Schema Format Update

**Date**: 2025-06-29  
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully

## Problem
The `column_schemas.yaml` file was extremely long and difficult to browse due to datasets with many columns being stored as YAML lists (one column per line). For example, `a_aCompustat` took ~120 lines just for its column list.

## Solution
Converted column storage from YAML lists to comma-delimited strings:

**Before:**
```yaml
a_aCompustat:
  columns:
  - gvkey
  - datadate
  - conm
  # ... 117 more lines
```

**After:**
```yaml
a_aCompustat:
  columns: "gvkey, datadate, conm, fyear, tic, cusip, ..."
```

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `column_standardizer_yaml.py`**: Added backward-compatible parsing for both string and list formats
2. **Converted `column_schemas.yaml`**: Transformed all 6 datasets to comma-delimited format
3. **Updated `extract_column_schemas.py`**: Modified to generate comma-delimited format directly (future-proofing)
4. **Tested thoroughly**: Verified `H_CRSPDistributions.py` and full workflow still work correctly

## Impact
- **File readability**: Dramatically improved - easy to browse and edit
- **Maintenance**: Much easier to review schema changes in git diffs
- **Functionality**: Zero impact - all existing code works unchanged
- **Future-proof**: New schema extractions automatically use compact format

## Testing
- ✅ End-to-end workflow tested successfully
- ✅ Column standardization works correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
