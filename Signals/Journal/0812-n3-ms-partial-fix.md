# MS Predictor: Partial Fix Applied

## Issue Identified

**Root Cause**: Missing upper bound condition in final score logic.

**Stata Code**:
```stata
replace MS = 6 if tempMS >= 6 & tempMS <= 8
replace MS = 1 if tempMS <= 1
```

**Original Python Code** (WRONG):
```python
pl.when(pl.col("tempMS") >= 6).then(pl.lit(6))  # Missing <= 8 condition!
pl.when(pl.col("tempMS") <= 1).then(pl.lit(1))
```

**Fixed Python Code**:
```python
pl.when((pl.col("tempMS") >= 6) & (pl.col("tempMS") <= 8)).then(pl.lit(6))
pl.when(pl.col("tempMS") <= 1).then(pl.lit(1))
```

## Impact

- **Logic Fix**: For tempMS = 9, Stata gives MS = 9, while original Python gave MS = 6
- **Test Result**: 63.453% failure rate unchanged (issue is deeper in pipeline)
- **Root Problem**: The fundamental issue is in tempMS calculation, not final score logic

## Remaining Issues

The fix addresses a logical bug but doesn't resolve the main validation failure because:

1. **Most failing observations have tempMS â‰¤ 1** (so final score logic doesn't matter)
2. **Real issue**: The 8 Mohanram components (m1-m8) or timing logic differs systematically
3. **Pattern**: Python consistently gets lower tempMS values than Stata

## Next Steps (if continuing)

Would need to debug:
1. **Individual m1-m8 components** for specific failing observations
2. **Rolling aggregations** (asrol vs polars rolling)
3. **Timing/forward-fill logic** differences
4. **Industry median calculations** 

## Conclusion

Applied a correct logical fix, but MS remains a complex predictor requiring extensive debugging to fully resolve.

**Status**: Partial fix applied, major validation issues remain.
