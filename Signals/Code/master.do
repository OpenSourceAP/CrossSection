** Master file

/*
This code is set up to run with the following path structure (Data and Log folders are created automatically)

+---Signals
+---/Code          (contains scripts that call other scripts and SAS/R files)
|   /Data          (contains all data download scripts)
|   /Logs          (contains log files created during running scripts) 

Optional inputs:
	/Data/Prep/
		iclink.csv		
		OptionMetrics.csv
		tr_13f.csv
		corwin_schultz_spread.csv		

These are created by code in Signals/PrepScripts/.  They are required for producing the signals that use IBES (iclink.csv), OptionMetrics, and Thomson-Reuter's 
13f data, but master.do will still produce the CRSP-Compustat signals if you do not have them.  corwin_schultz_spread.csv is only used for the BidAskSpread predictor.
