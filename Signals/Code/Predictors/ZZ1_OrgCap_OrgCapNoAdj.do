// 2021 AC
// OP actually is value weighted, we previously had EW
// also updated: dec and sic restriction, missing xsga => 0,  drop OrgCapNoAdj == 0
// also updated: price index deflation (using GNP defl), this helps too
// Keeping only december fyr ends is absolutely critical for some reason
// Is the unadjusted version even predictive? 
//	I don't see it in OP.  Page 18 top discusses the industry adjustment
// 	HXZ find that it is in the full sample, with deciles
//	it seems that in our data, deciles is required to make this predictive, 
//	and it works a lot better in the full sample (post 2008)
// OP gets tstat of 2.85 for OrgCap, we get 2.3 ish, 
// 	perhaps because we skip the cpi
// OrgCapNoAdj is not predictive for us, t-stat = 1.20 insamp, but works better postpub
//	and also in deciles
