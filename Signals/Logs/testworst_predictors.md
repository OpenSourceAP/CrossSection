## Detailed Analysis

This section focuses on the 20 worst predictors by Superset and Precision1 metrics.

## Worst Superset

Predictors with highest superset failure rates (Python missing the most Stata observations):

- **MS**
  - Script: MS
  - Python CSV: yes
  - Superset: yes (100%)
  - Precision1: no (40.96%) ❌
  - Precision2: no (99.900th diff 3.2E+00) ❌

## Worst Precision1

Predictors with highest precision1 failure rates (highest percentage of observations with significant differences):

- **MS**
  - Script: MS
  - Python CSV: yes
  - Superset: yes (100%)
  - Precision1: no (40.96%) ❌
  - Precision2: no (99.900th diff 3.2E+00) ❌
