  - Script: DivSeason
  - Python CSV: yes
  - Superset: yes (100%)
  - Precision1: yes (0.78%)
  - Precision2: no (99.900th diff 2.0E+00) ❌

## Worst Precision1

Predictors with highest precision1 failure rates (highest percentage of observations with significant differences):

- **DivSeason**
  - Script: DivSeason
  - Python CSV: yes
  - Superset: yes (100%)
