## Detailed Analysis

This section focuses on the 20 worst predictors by Superset and Precision1 metrics.

## Worst Superset

Predictors with highest superset failure rates (Python missing the most Stata observations):

- **MomSeasonShort**
  - Script: MomSeasonShort
  - Python CSV: yes
  - Superset: yes (100%)
  - Precision1: yes (0.00%)
  - Precision2: yes (99.900th diff 1.7E-07)

## Worst Precision1

Predictors with highest precision1 failure rates (highest percentage of observations with significant differences):

- **MomSeasonShort**
  - Script: MomSeasonShort
  - Python CSV: yes
  - Superset: yes (100%)
  - Precision1: yes (0.00%)
  - Precision2: yes (99.900th diff 1.7E-07)
