# Manual Overrides for Validation Failures
# 
# This file allows manual approval of validation failures with auditable paper trails.
# Each override should include justification and reviewer information.
#
# Structure:
#   dataset_name:
#     - check: [check_name]              # Required: name of the validation check
#       status: accepted|rejected          # Required: approval decision
#       reviewed_on: YYYY-MM-DD          # Required: date of review  
#       reviewed_by: [reviewer_id]       # Required: who reviewed this
#       details: |                       # Required: justification
#         Multi-line explanation of the decision
#       max_ratio_allowed: X.XX%         # Optional: custom threshold for accepted ratio checks
#
# Supported checks for DataDownloads (test_dl.py):
#   - missing_rows: Python missing some Stata rows
#   - imperfect_rows: High imperfect rows ratio
#   - imperfect_cells: High imperfect cells ratio
#   - column_names: Column names don't match
#   - column_types: Column types don't match
#
# Supported checks for Predictors (test_predictors.py):
#   - superset_check: Python observations not superset of Stata
#   - precision_check: Pth percentile absolute difference too high
#   - column_names: Column names don't match

# Example entries (remove these when adding real overrides):

#       This failure indicates a real data quality issue that needs to be fixed.
#       The validation failure should remain until the underlying problem is resolved.

    details: |
      Only 4 Stata observations are missing from Python data out of 516,269 total rows (0.0008%).
      This minimal difference is acceptable given database access limitations and timing differences
      between Stata and Python data downloads. The missing rows represent <0.001% of the dataset
      and do not materially impact data quality or analysis integrity.
