      The 4 missing rows are now gone from Compustat. The missing rows are for gvkeys 022371, 029251, 036153, 038001, with datadates that are one year before the first available datadate in the updated Compustat data. They're also almost entirely missing accounting numbers. Seems like Compustat cleaned it up.
