# Predictor Validation Overrides
# 
# This file allows manual approval of validation failures at the predictor level.
# If a predictor is listed here with status: accepted, all its validation 
# failures will be treated as acceptable.

# Structure:

# Supported validation checks that can be overridden:
#   - Column names: Column names and order match exactly
#   - Superset check: Python observations are superset of Stata observations  
#   - Precision1: Percentage with std_diff >= TOL_DIFF_1 < TOL_OBS_1
#   - Precision2: Pth percentile absolute difference < TOL_DIFF_2

    The standardized deviation is on average 1% with a sd of 7 pp. So it's above the threshold, but it's small. Sumstats and regressions show that the replication works very well. Regressing python on stata shows that the coefficient is 0.9959 and the Rsq is 0.995. This is a complicated file, so it makes sense that there will be some deviations later in the code, which is where PredictedFE is created.

    There was a bug with the Stata code's winsorization. No way to replicate this. There's also a typo in the Stata formula for this. See https://github.com/OpenSourceAP/CrossSection/issues/177
