# Plan: update asrol everywhere once again

Aug 15 afternoon: the GPT5 asrol was too slow. let's go back to what we had for most scripts, and use GPT5's solution only when required.

- GPT5's solution is in `utils/asrol_pedantic.py`
- The old solution is in `utils/asrol.py`

## Task 1: update asrol everywhere to use the old solution

If the user requests a script, work on that one. Otherwise, work on the first TBC script in the list below.
