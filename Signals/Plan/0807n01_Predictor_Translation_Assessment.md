### Priority Classification

**HIGH**: Easy translation + high research value + similar to existing patterns
**MEDIUM**: Moderate complexity but important for completeness  
**LOW**: Complex/specialized predictors that can be deferred

## Translation Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Difficulty 1-2, ~8 predictors)
Start with IBES-based and simple CRSP calculations. These have similar patterns to existing translations.

### Phase 2: Core Coverage (Difficulty 3-4, ~20 predictors)  
Focus on earnings, growth, and standard financial metrics that form the backbone of factor research.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Difficulty 5-6, ~15 predictors)
Tackle complex multi-source predictors that require substantial development time.

### Phase 4: Specialized Methods (Difficulty 7-10, ~22 predictors)
Reserve for future development or specialized research needs.
