## example task 

try to fix the NumRows test failure in @pyCode/Predictors/LRreversal.py. 
use @pyCode/utils/test_predictors.py --predictors to compare 
with @"Logs/" testout_predictors 0826n1.md" to make sure the fix is an improvement. Include the tstat test     

## progress tracking

- AccrualsBM: fixed
- Activism1: fixed
- RDcap: fixed
    - with new fill_gaps option in stata_multi_lag (also stata_lag)
- LRreversal: fixed
- Cash: partial fix
- OperProf: fixed
- CompEquIss: fixed
- RDS: fixed
- MRreversal: fixed
- Illiquidity: fixed
- OperProfRD: fixed
- IntMom: fixed
- EarningsConsistency: attempted
    - needs human intervention
- BetaFP: NumRows fixed (9.5% -> -0.37%), precision issues remain
- roaq: NumRows fixed (+8.99% -> -0.00%), removed incorrect ffill
- FirmAgeMom: fixed

## common issues
- remove incorrect fillna(0) calls
- follow stata lag procedure using stata_lag or stata_multi_lag
