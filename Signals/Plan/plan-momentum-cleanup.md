# Plan for momentum cleanup

The goal is to make sure all momentum scripts are nice and clean. They should use these functions from utils/*.py:
- stata_multi_lag for lag operations
- asrol for rolling operations
- save_predictor for saving the results

If the script is already nice and clean, mark it with ✅.
If it is not, fix it, and then mark it with ✅.
