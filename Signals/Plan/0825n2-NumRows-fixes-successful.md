# NumRows Test Fixes - Successful Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-25  
**Session**: Claude Code Session implementing NumRows fixes

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### Root Cause Analysis
The main issues causing NumRows test failures were:

1. **Merge Logic Mismatches**: Python used `left` merges while Stata used `keep(master match)` which corresponds to `inner` merges
2. **Signal Construction Logic Errors**: Some predictors had incorrect logic that created far more observations than intended

### Fixes Applied and Results

#### 1. Merge Logic Fixes (left → inner)

**Cash.py** (line 86-87):
- **Before**: `how='left'` → +22.72% rows vs Stata ❌
- **After**: `how='inner'` → +7.28% rows vs Stata ⚠️ (improved but still above 5% threshold)
- **Status**: Significant improvement, close to passing

**EarnSupBig.py** (lines 216, 318):  
- **Before**: `how='left'` → +13.93% rows vs Stata ❌
- **After**: `how='inner'` → +0.37% rows vs Stata ✅
- **Status**: **PASSED NumRows test**

**DivInit.py** (line 35):
- **Before**: `how='left'` → +8.99% rows vs Stata ❌  
- **After**: `how='inner'` → 0.00% rows vs Stata ✅
- **Status**: **PERFECT match, PASSED NumRows test**

**IntMom.py** (line 39):
- **Before**: `how='left'` → +9.79% rows vs Stata ❌
- **After**: `how='inner'` → Still +9.79% rows vs Stata ❌
- **Status**: No improvement (self-join case, inner merge doesn't help much)

#### 2. Signal Construction Logic Fixes

**AccrualsBM.py** (lines 83, 128-132):
- **Issue**: Used "relaxed criteria" with ranges (e.g., `tempqBM >= 4`) and extreme logic 
- **Root cause**: Stata uses very strict logic: only `tempqBM==5 & tempqAcc==1` OR `tempqBM==1 & tempqAcc==5`
- **Before**: `how='right'` + wrong logic → +586.85% rows vs Stata ❌
- **After**: `how='inner'` + exact Stata logic → +0.69% rows vs Stata ✅
- **Status**: **PASSED NumRows test**

## Key Insights

### 1. Stata's `keep(master match)` = Python `inner` merge
When Stata code shows `merge ... keep(master match)`, this should be translated as `how='inner'` in pandas, not `how='left'`.

### 2. Signal Logic Must Be Exact
Even small deviations in signal construction logic can create massive row count differences. The AccrualsBM case showed how "relaxed criteria" created 6x more observations than intended.

### 3. Self-Join Cases Are Different  
In IntMom.py, the merge is a self-join for time-based lags. The left→inner change doesn't help much because it's joining the same dataset to itself at different time periods.

## Successfully Fixed Predictors

| Predictor | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **AccrualsBM** | +586.85% ❌ | +0.69% ✅ | **PASSED** |
| **EarnSupBig** | +13.93% ❌ | +0.37% ✅ | **PASSED** |  
| **DivInit** | +8.99% ❌ | 0.00% ✅ | **PASSED** |
| **Cash** | +22.72% ❌ | +7.28% ⚠️ | Improved |

## Remaining NumRows Issues

Based on the original log analysis, these predictors still likely need fixing:

### High Priority (>15% difference)
- **PS** - +32.28% rows vs Stata
- **HerfAsset** - +26.63% rows vs Stata  
- **TrendFactor** - +21.81% rows vs Stata
- **CompEquIss** - +18.85% rows vs Stata
- **LRreversal** - +15.05% rows vs Stata

### Medium Priority (5-15% difference)
- **IntMom** - +9.79% rows vs Stata (merge fix didn't help)
- **Illiquidity** - +9.77% rows vs Stata
- **OperProf** - +5.20% rows vs Stata

### Note on Overridden Predictors
- **Recomm_ShortInterest** (+39.71%) and **CredRatDG** (+18.83%) have existing overrides
- These may be acceptable due to data improvements or known Stata bugs

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Apply merge logic pattern** to remaining predictors (PS, HerfAsset, CompEquIss, LRreversal)
2. **Investigate data construction logic** for predictors where merge fixes don't work
3. **Consider TrendFactor override** if recent commit notes indicate Stata bugs
4. **Validate IntMom time-based join logic** for self-join optimization

## Impact Assessment  

**Major Success**: Fixed 3 critical NumRows failures, with AccrualsBM being the most dramatic improvement (586% → 0.69%).

**Method Validation**: The approach of identifying merge logic mismatches proved highly effective for most predictors.
